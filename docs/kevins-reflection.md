## What Did I Learn?

Working on this project helped me learn how to work with others in a GitHub repo. At first, we didn’t know how to start, but by trying different things, we eventually got the hang of it. We worked on two different repos because we forked the main one to make our changes separately. Each of us had our own repo to experiment with, and once our work was done, we merged it back into the main repo. We each made our own branch for different parts of the project, and when we finished, we merged our branches into the develop branch. This way, everyone’s work came together without breaking the main part of the project. I also learned how to fix problems when two people changed the same part of the code. We used pull requests to check each other’s work before adding it to the project. Additionally, I learned how to create GitHub issues to track tasks and bugs, which helped keep us organized and on the same page.
