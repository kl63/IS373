## What Did I Learn?

Working on this project helped me learn how to work with others in a GitHub repo. At first, we faced some challenges and didn’t know how to start, which made the beginning feel a bit overwhelming. However, we embraced the learning process by trying different things and experimenting with various approaches. This trial-and-error method allowed us to explore our options, and eventually, we got the hang of it.

We worked on two different repositories because we forked the main one to make our changes separately. This approach was helpful because it allowed each of us to have our own space to experiment without affecting the original project. Once our individual work was completed, we merged our changes back into the main repo. This collaborative effort required good communication and coordination among team members.

Throughout the project, we each created our own branches for different parts of the development process. This branching strategy allowed us to focus on specific features without disrupting the work of others. When we finished our tasks, we merged our branches into the develop branch, ensuring that everyone’s contributions came together smoothly. This process taught me the importance of maintaining a stable main branch while still being able to develop new features.

I also learned how to handle merge conflicts, which often occur when two people change the same part of the code. This experience helped me understand the importance of clear communication and how to resolve differences effectively. We used pull requests to review each other’s work, which was a great way to provide feedback and ensure the quality of the code before it was added to the project.

Additionally, I discovered how to create GitHub issues to track tasks and bugs. This feature was incredibly helpful for keeping our team organized and on the same page. By documenting what needed to be done and any issues that arose, we were able to manage our workload better and ensure that nothing fell through the cracks. Overall, this project not only improved my technical skills but also taught me valuable lessons in teamwork, collaboration, and effective project management.
